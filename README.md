# SHAPEAI-CYBER-SECURITY-BOOTCAMP
I made this project during the **_7 Days Free Bootcamp_**, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Harsh Akshit bhaiya (Instructor and Mentor at Google). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Kali Linux
<li>SQL Injection
<li>OWASP
<li>CTF
<li>API
<br>During these 7 days, everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience in programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
